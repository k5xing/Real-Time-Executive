# Real-Time-Executive
Lab Projects Developed in ECE350

The project is a small Real- Time Executive (RTX) for Keil MCB1700 board populated with an NXP LPC1768 microcontroller. There are four cumulative labs in total to finish the project. Only the final project is included in the src folder, and the work done in each lab is described below. The detailed information of this project can be seen on Page 7 of [project overview.pdf](https://github.com/k5xing/Project-Overview/blob/main/project%20overview%20-%20Kehan%20Xing.pdf).

### Lab 1: Introduction to Kernel Programming and Memory Management
This lab is to implement the binary buddy system dynamic memory allocator for the kernel to manage physical on-chip random access memory (RAM) on the board.


### Lab 2: Task Management
This lab is to design and implement a multitasking kernel and a preemptive priority scheduler the kernel uses to schedule tasks.

### Lab 3: Inter-task Communications and Console I/O
This lab is to add message-based inter-task communication system calls.

### Lab 4: Timing Service and Real-Time Scheduling 
This lab is to design and implement system calls and the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduler to create and schedule real-time tasks.
